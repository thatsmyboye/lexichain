## Implementation Details

### 1. Store Item Added
- **Item ID**: `unlock_all_modes`
- **Price**: $9.99
- **Description**: "Instantly unlock all 6 Advanced Game Modes - Time Attack, Endless, Puzzle, Survival, Zen, and more!"
- **Icon**: ðŸš€
- **Location**: `src/components/store/ConsumableStore.tsx`

### 2. Database Support
- **New Table**: `user_unlocked_modes`

- **Fields**:

  - `user_id` (UUID, Foreign Key to auth.users)
  - `mode_id` (TEXT, Game mode identifier)
  - `unlocked_at` (TIMESTAMP)
  - `source` (TEXT, e.g., 'stripe_purchase_xxx')
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPS)
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20250120000000_add_user_unlocked_modes.sql`

### 3. Payment Processing
- **Updated**: `supabase/functions/create-payment/index.ts`
  - Added `unlock_all_modes` to `STRIPE_PRODUCT_IDS` mapping
  - **TODO**: Replace `"prod_unlock_all_modes"` with actual Stripe product ID
- **Updated**: `supabase/functions/verify-payment/index.ts`
  - Added special handling for `unlock_all_modes` purchases
  - Unlocks all advanced modes: `['time_attack', 'endless', 'puzzle', 'survival', 'zen']`

### 4. Frontend Integration
- **New Hook**: `src/hooks/useUnlockedModes.ts`
  - Fetches unlocked modes from database
  - Returns `Set<AdvancedGameMode>` of purchased unlocks
- **Updated**: `src/components/game/AdvancedGameModes.tsx`
  - Now uses `useUnlockedModes` hook
  - Combines purchased unlocks with level-based unlocks
  - Added `user` prop to interface
- **Updated**: Components using `AdvancedGameModes`
  - `src/components/Phase3Integration.tsx`
  - `src/pages/Index.tsx`

### 5. UI Changes
- **New Store Section**: "Game Mode Unlocks"
- **Special Styling**: Orange gradient card with rocket icon
- **Prominent Display**: Larger card with "New!" badge

## Required Next Steps

### 1. Stripe Integration
- Create a new product in Stripe Dashboard for "Unlock All Advanced Modes"
- Update `STRIPE_PRODUCT_IDS.unlock_all_modes` with the actual Stripe product ID
- Set the price to $9.99 in Stripe

### 2. Testing
- Test the complete purchase flow
- Verify that modes are properly unlocked after purchase
- Test with both authenticated and guest users

### 3. Database Migration
- Run the migration: `supabase/migrations/20250120000000_add_user_unlocked_modes.sql`
- Verify the table is created correctly

## Pricing Rationale
- **$9.99** was chosen as a reasonable price point because:
  - Higher than individual consumables ($0.99) but lower than ultimate bundle ($15.99)
  - Represents good value for unlocking all advanced content immediately
  - Follows common gaming industry pricing for "unlock all" packages
  - Unlocks content that would normally require reaching level 10+ (significant time investment)

## Advanced Game Modes Unlocked
1. **Time Attack** - Race against the clock (normally unlocked at level 0)
2. **Endless** - Continuous gameplay with escalating difficulty (normally unlocked at level 5)
3. **Puzzle** - Pre-designed challenges (normally unlocked at level 10)
4. **Survival** - Survive increasing challenges (normally unlocked at level 8)
5. **Zen** - Relaxed gameplay (normally unlocked at level 0)
6. **Classic** - Original experience (always available)

The purchase unlocks all modes regardless of user level, providing immediate access to the full game experience.
